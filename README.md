## Regex engine implementation from scratch
This repository is an attempt to understand how parsers work on a fundamental level. As I build this, I'm reading through a lot (A LOT) of theory
related to Grammars, Parsers, Different parsing techniques, compilers and how to build one.
I've divided the work into modules and I've left a few excercises for anyone who wants to understand how the code, functor, monads perform.
